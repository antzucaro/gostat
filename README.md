This is the start of an implementation of the front page of [XonStat](https://github.com/antzucaro/xonstat) using the Go programming language. I'm doing this mainly to get a feel for how database-driven web applications work in Golang. I intend to start off with everything in one file and then expand out into multiple packages for better structuring.

This is making use of the Martini web application framework for dependency injection and the "pq" PostgreSQL library. I'm also trying to stick to the vanilla html/template package to see how far that takes me.

Note: this stuff is for learning only. If you have pointers, do share! Otherwise - cheers and happy coding.
